# HoTMiX

HoTMiX is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of starting new web projects. It allows developers to quickly scaffold projects using the HTMX framework, coupled with a choice of popular backend technologies like Flask, Gin, and Node.js.

## Features

- **Easy Scaffolding**: Quickly set up a new HTMX project with a simple command.
- **Multiple Backends**: Supports various backend technologies including Flask, Gin, and Node.js, with more to be added.
- **HTMX Integration**: Leverage the power of HTMX for dynamic, efficient web applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (for Flask)
- Go (for Gin)
- Node.js (for Node.js backend)

### Installation

Still in the very early stages of development.


## Usage

### Setting Up a Python Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
   - Run `python -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named `venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you are in the project directory where `requirements.txt` is located.
   - Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Creating a New Project  (not working yet)

To create a new HTMX project with a Flask backend, run the following command:

hotmix create myproject --backend flask

Replace `myproject` with your desired project name and `flask` with the backend of your choice (flask/gin/nodejs).
